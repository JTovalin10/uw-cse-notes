large scale software must be correct and:
- easy to test
- easy to understand
- easy to change

# Abstraction
- an abstraction hides details in part of the code
	- high level description, avoiding low level detail

## procedural abstraction
- provided for a method via its specification
	- must describe the i/o behavior
	- need not describe every detail of how its works
## abstraction barrier
- implementer promises code satisfied the specification
- client promises not to depend on hidden details
# Specification
- a good specification is precise
- - cannot have confusion about required behavior

# AI and Abstraction
- at present, AI does not respect abstraction barrier
	- it should be possible to fix this in the future
- writing specs is neccessary
	- must distinguish deetails that are incidental vs essential
	- AI cannot read your mind
