Let $X$ be a random variable supported (only) on non-negative numbers. for any $t > 0$
$$
\mathbb{P}(X \geq t) \leq \frac{\mathbb{E}[X]}{t}
$$
Furthermore, to apply this bound we need to know
1. its non-negative
2. its expectation

[[Chebyshev's Inequality]]

When is this better to use:
1. When we only know the mean ($E[X]$)
2. When we have a small deviation from the mean
3. High Variance Situations
