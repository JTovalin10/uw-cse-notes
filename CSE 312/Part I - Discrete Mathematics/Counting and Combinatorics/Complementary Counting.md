To sound a set A, where we want to find the complement we do 
$|A| = |U \setminus A^- |$
This can be used if we want to find the complement of a problem where we have all options such as a set {a,b,c,...,z} and want to find all permutations of length 5. But, we restrict it to exclude a, so U would be $26^5$ and $A^-$ would be $25^5$ then subtracting these two will result in the complement
