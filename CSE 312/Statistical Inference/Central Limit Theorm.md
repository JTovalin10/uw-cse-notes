The sum of any independent random variable approaches a normal distribution
$$
Y_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2+...+X_n-n\mu}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}
$$
As $n \rightarrow \infty$  , the CDF of $Y_n$ converges to the CDF of $N(0, 1$
[[Normal Random Variable]]
We solve with 
When $Y_n = 0$ we can use continuity correction
$P(m.5 < X < n.5)$ 
where m + 1 = n

When we want the avg, fraction, or proportion of outcomes
$$
	Z = \frac{\frac{X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n}{n} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{\mu}}
$$
The shortcut to finding the bottom is finding the variance of $\mathbb{P}(X < n)$ then we take the square root

We want to use simple distributions (non-sum) to find the variance, then apply the CLT to find the probability we are attempting to find
