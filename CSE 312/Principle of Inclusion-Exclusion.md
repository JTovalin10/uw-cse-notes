$$
\mid A \cup B \mid \quad = \quad  \mid A \mid + \mid B \mid - \mid A \cap B \mid
$$

- for three or more the general formula is 
$$
\mid A \cup B \cup C \mid \quad = \quad \mid A\mid + \mid B \mid + \mid C\mid - \mid A \cap B \mid - \mid B \cap C\mid - \mid A \cap C\mid + \mid A\cap B \cap C\mid 
$$
we subtract each intersect individually, then add back the intersection of all sets
