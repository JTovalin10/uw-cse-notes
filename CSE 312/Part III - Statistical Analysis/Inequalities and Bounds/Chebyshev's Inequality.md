Let $X$ be a random variable. For any $t > 0$. Note that $t = n - E[X]$ where n is the $P(X \leq n)$

$$
\mathbb{P}(|X - \mathbb{E}[X]| \geq t) \leq \frac{Var[X]}{t^2}
$$
For this we would need to know:
1. It's expectation
2. it's variance
[[Markov Inequality]]

When its better to use:
1. For large deviations from the mean
2. when the variance is small
3. when you need lower and higher bound
