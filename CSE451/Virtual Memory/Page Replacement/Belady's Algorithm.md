This algorithm has the lowest fault rate (proveable) and all it does is:
1. evict the page that won't be used for the longest time in the future
2. problem: impossible to predict the future

This algorithm is only useful as a measuring tool to compare other algorithms to check if this one isnt that much better than yours
