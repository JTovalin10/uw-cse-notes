[[Secondary Storage]] devices are crude and awkward

# what is it
- file system: a convenient abstraction
- defines logical objects like files and directories
	- hide details about where on disk files live
- as well as operations on objects like read and write
	- read/write bytes ranges instead of blocks
- a [[File]] is the basic unit of long-term storage
- A [[Directory]] is just a special kind of file
- NOTE:
	- sequential byte stream is only one possibility
