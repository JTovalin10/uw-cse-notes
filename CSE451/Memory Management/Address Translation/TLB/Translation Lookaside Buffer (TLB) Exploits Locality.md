# TLB Exploits Locality
Processes only use a handful of pages at a time, so the TLB can hold the **hot set** (working set) — making hit rates very high.

| locality type | why it helps the TLB |
|---------------|----------------------|
| temporal | recently accessed pages will likely be accessed again — same entry gets reused |
| spatial | nearby addresses share a page, so one TLB entry covers many sequential accesses |

hit rate is the key performance metric — even a small TLB (32–256 entries) covers most accesses
