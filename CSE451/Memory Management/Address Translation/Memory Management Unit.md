# What is it
The Memory Management Unit (MMU) is a specialized hardware component usually integrated directly into the CPU (Central Processing Unit).

Its primary job is to handle all memory and caching operations associated with the processor. It acts as the "bridge" or translator between the software (which uses virtual addresses) and the actual hardware RAM (which uses physical addresses).
