# Application Control of Hardware
## Advantages
-  No OS middleman (little to no latency)
- Clients can potentially implement it faster

## Disadvantages
- Malicious code is easier to create
- if someone creates an attack, they have full access to the computer since the kernel cannot protect it
- have to rely on programmer to create a clean up mechanism if their code fails
