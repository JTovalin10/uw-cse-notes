# What is it
A hardware-initated event that causes a transfer of control from a user program to the kernel. An Exception differs from [[Interrupts]] and [[Traps]] as it's the hardware way of saying *I cannot continue executing this user program safely; the OS needs to take over*
# Examples
- Divide by zero
- segfault
