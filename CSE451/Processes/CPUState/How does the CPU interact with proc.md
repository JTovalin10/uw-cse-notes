- when a process is running, its CPU state is inside the CPU
	- [[Registers]]
	- CPU contains current values
- When the OS gets control because of a...
	- [[Traps]]: program executing syscall
	- [[Exception]]: Program does something unexpected
	- [[Interrupts]]: A hardware device requests service
- The OS saves the CPU state of the running process in that process's proc
- When the OS returns the process to the running state, it loads the hardware registers with values from that process's proc — general [[Registers]], stack pointers, instruction pointers
- the act of switching the CPU from one process to another is called a [[Context Switch]]
	- systems may do 100+ of switches/sec
	- takes a few microseconds on todays hardware
- choosing which process to run next is called [[Scheduling]]
