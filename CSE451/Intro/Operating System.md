# What is an Operating System
software to manage a computer's resources for its users and applications

# What Are Some Challenges
## Portability 
- For programs: 
	- Application programming interface (API)
	- Abstract virtual machine (AVM)
- For the operating system
	- Hardware abstraction layer
## Reliability
- does the system do what it was designed to do
## Availability
- what portion of time is the system working
- Mean Time To Failure (MTTF), Mean Time to Repair
## Security
- can the system be compromised by an attacker
## Privacy
- Data is accessible only to authorized users
## Performance
- Latency/response time
	- how long does an operation take to complete
- Throughput
	- how many operations can be done per unit of time
- Overhead
	- how much extra work is done by the OS
	- Me: compared to doing it without the OS
- Fairness
	- How equal is the performance received by different users
- Predictability
	- How consistent is the performance over time
## Backward and Forward Compatibility
- Can it run legacy apps
	- think hospitals and windows 98
- how to accommodate growing or advancing hardware
	- word size or memory size
