# CSE 461 - Computer Networks

## Course Overview

CSE 461 covers the fundamentals of computer networking. The course explores how data is transmitted across networks, from the physical layer up through application protocols, following the layered network model.

## Topics Covered

### Network Components and Protocols
- Network component names: hosts, routers, applications
- Types of links: wired vs wireless
- Wireless link characteristics
- Computer network names by scale (LAN, WAN, etc.)
- Protocols and layering concepts
- Encapsulation

### OSI Model Layers
- Seven-layer OSI reference model
- Layer responsibilities and interfaces
- Layering benefits and trade-offs

### Physical Layer
- How information is transmitted across links
- Modulation techniques
- Simple rate model
- Message latency calculations
- Bandwidth and throughput

### Link Layer
- Data link protocols
- Framing and error detection
- Media access control
