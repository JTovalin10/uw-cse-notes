## Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)
A mechanism that partitions a single physical [[Switched Network]] into multiple isolated logical LANs. Each VLAN is identified by a **VLAN ID** added to the Ethernet frame header.

- Hosts in the same VLAN can communicate as if on the same physical LAN
- Traffic between VLANs must go through a router
- Allows network segmentation without rewiring physical infrastructure
