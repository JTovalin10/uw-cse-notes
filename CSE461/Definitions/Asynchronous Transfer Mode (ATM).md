## Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
A networking technology that uses fixed-size **53-byte cells** (5-byte header + 48-byte payload) for fast switching. ATM uses [[Virtual Circuit (VC)|virtual circuits]] and identifies connections with a combination of [[Virtual Path Identifier (VPI)|VPI]] and [[Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI)|VCI]].

The fixed cell size enables hardware-optimized switching but introduces **cell tax** — overhead from headers on small payloads.
