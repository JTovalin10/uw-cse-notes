## Virtual Path Identifier (VPI)
The upper portion of the 24-bit identifier in an [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)|ATM]] cell header. Groups multiple [[Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI)|VCIs]] into a single **virtual path** so switches can forward all circuits in the group by looking at only the VPI bits, reducing [[Forwarding Table]] size.
