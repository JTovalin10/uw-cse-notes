## Subnet
A subdivision of an IP network. Subnetting takes the host portion of an IP address and splits it into a subnet part and a host part, allowing a single network address to be internally divided into multiple smaller networks.

A **subnet mask** defines which bits of the address identify the subnet vs. the host. For example, a /24 subnet mask (255.255.255.0) means the first 24 bits identify the network+subnet and the last 8 bits identify the host.
