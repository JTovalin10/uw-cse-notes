## Internet Service Provider (ISP)
An organization that provides Internet connectivity to customers. ISPs operate at different tiers:
- **Tier 1** — global backbone networks that peer with each other
- **Tier 2** — regional networks that buy transit from Tier 1
- **Tier 3** — local providers that connect end users (via DSL, fiber, cable, etc.)
