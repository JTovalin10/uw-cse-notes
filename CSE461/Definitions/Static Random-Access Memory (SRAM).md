## Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)
A type of memory that is significantly faster than [[Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM)|DRAM]] but more expensive and lower density. SRAM does not need to be periodically refreshed, which contributes to its speed.

- **Speed**: ~1-10 ns access time (vs ~50-70 ns for DRAM)
- **Use in networking**: used in [[Hardware Switch|hardware switches]] to buffer packets during processing, and in [[Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM)|TCAM]] for fast forwarding table lookups
- **Trade-off**: faster but more expensive per bit than DRAM, so used in smaller quantities (caches, buffers)
