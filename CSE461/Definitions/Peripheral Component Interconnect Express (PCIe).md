## Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe)
A high-speed I/O bus standard used to connect hardware devices (such as [[Network Interface Card (NIC)|NICs]] and GPUs) to a computer's CPU and main memory. In networking, PCIe is the bus over which [[Direct Memory Access (DMA)|DMA]] transfers move packet data between NICs and memory.
