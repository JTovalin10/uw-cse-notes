## Link-State Packet (LSP)
An update packet generated by a node in a link-state routing protocol. Each LSP contains:
1. The ID of the node that created it
2. A list of directly connected neighbors and the cost of each link
3. A sequence number (to distinguish newer from older versions)
4. A [[CSE461/Definitions/Time to Live (TTL)]] (to expire stale information)

LSPs are distributed to all nodes via reliable flooding and are used to build each node's complete map of the network topology.
