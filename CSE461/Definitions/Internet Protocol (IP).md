## Internet Protocol (IP)
The network-layer protocol that provides the [[Datagram]] delivery service for the Internet. IP defines addressing (32-bit addresses in IPv4, 128-bit in IPv6) and handles routing packets across heterogeneous networks through [[Encapsulation]].

Key properties of IP's service model:
- [[Connectionless]] (datagram-based)
- Best-effort delivery (no guarantees on reliability, ordering, or timing)
- Supports [[IP Fragmentation and Reassembly|fragmentation]] when packets exceed a link's [[Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)|MTU]]
