Sharing a system resource among multiple users, similar to timesharing a computer. Three main approaches:

- **[[Synchronous Time-Division Multiplexing]]** — round-robin time slots
- **[[Frequency-Division Multiplexing]]** — each flow at a different frequency
- **[[Statistical Multiplexing]]** — on-demand, no wasted slots
