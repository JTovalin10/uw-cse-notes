## Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)
A media access mechanism used in [[Long-Term Evolution (LTE)|LTE]] that divides the radio channel into a 2D grid of **subcarriers** (frequency) and **time slots**. The base station ([[Broadband Base Unit (BBU)|BBU]]) allocates different resource blocks to different [[User Equipment (UE)|UEs]] based on feedback about channel quality.
