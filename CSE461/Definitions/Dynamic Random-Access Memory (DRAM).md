## Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM)
The standard main memory in computers. Stores each bit as a charge in a capacitor, which must be periodically **refreshed** to retain data.

- **Speed**: ~50-70 ns access time
- **Cheaper and denser** than [[Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)|SRAM]], so used for large memory (main memory, buffers)
- In networking, DRAM is the main memory in [[Software Switch|software switches]] where packets are buffered during store-and-forward processing
