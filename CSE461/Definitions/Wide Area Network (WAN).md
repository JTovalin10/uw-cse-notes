## Wide Area Network (WAN)
A network that spans a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or continent. WANs interconnect [[Local Area Network (LAN)|LANs]] and typically have higher latency and lower bandwidth per link than LANs.

The Internet is the largest WAN, built by interconnecting many smaller networks through [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP]] routing.
