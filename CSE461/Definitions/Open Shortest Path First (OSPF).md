## Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
A widely used link-state routing protocol that adds to the basic link-state algorithm:
1. **Authentication** of routing messages
2. **Hierarchy** — domains partitioned into areas for scalability
3. **Load balancing** — equal-cost routes share traffic

Uses [[Link-State Advertisement (LSA)|LSAs]] and Dijkstra's algorithm for route calculation.
