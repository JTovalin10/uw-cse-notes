## Quality of Service (QoS)
A performance-related guarantee the network provides to a traffic flow. Examples include:
- Minimum bandwidth allocation on a link
- Maximum queuing delay bound
- Packet loss guarantees

Requires switches to **reserve resources** — easier to provide with [[Virtual Circuit (VC)|VCs]] than with [[Connectionless]] [[Datagram]] networks.
