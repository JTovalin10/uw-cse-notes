## Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)
A wireless technique that uses multiple antennas at both the sender and receiver to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously. Increases throughput roughly proportional to the number of antenna pairs, without requiring extra bandwidth or power.

Used in WiFi (802.11n and later) and [[Long-Term Evolution (LTE)|LTE]].
