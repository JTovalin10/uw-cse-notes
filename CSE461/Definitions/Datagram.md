## Datagram
A self-contained, independently routed packet. Each datagram carries the full destination address and is forwarded hop-by-hop through the network; routers make independent forwarding decisions for each packet using their [[Forwarding Table]].

Datagram networks are [[Connectionless]]—no connection setup is required before sending data. The Internet's [[CSE461/Definitions/Internet Protocol (IP)|IP]] layer uses datagram delivery.
