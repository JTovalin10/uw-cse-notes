A networking model where each packet is handled independently with no prior setup. The sender can transmit at any time without establishing a connection first. Each packet carries the full destination address and is forwarded based on the switch's [[Forwarding Table]].

Opposite of connection-oriented models like [[Virtual Circuit]] switching.
