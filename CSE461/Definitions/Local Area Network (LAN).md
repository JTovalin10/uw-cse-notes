## Local Area Network (LAN)
A network that covers a small geographic area, such as a building, campus, or home. Typically uses Ethernet or WiFi and operates at high speeds (100 Mbps to 10+ Gbps) with low latency.

Can be extended using [[Switch|switches]] and [[Learning Bridges|bridges]] to form an extended LAN, and segmented using [[Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)|VLANs]].
