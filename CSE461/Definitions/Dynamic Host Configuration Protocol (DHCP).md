## Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
A protocol that automatically assigns [[Internet Protocol (IP)|IP]] addresses to hosts from a pool of available addresses, minimizing the need for manual configuration.

A newly booted host broadcasts a `DHCPDISCOVER` message; a DHCP server (or relay agent) responds with an available IP address, subnet mask, and default router.
