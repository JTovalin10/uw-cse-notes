## Network Processor Unit (NPU)
A specialized processor with an architecture and instruction set optimized for processing packet headers at high speed. Found in [[Hardware Switch|hardware (bare-metal) switches]].

- Can be programmed to function as an L2 switch, L3 router, or both
- Works with [[Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)|SRAM]] and [[Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM)|TCAM]] for fast packet buffering and lookup
