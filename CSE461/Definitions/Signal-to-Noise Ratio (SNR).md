## Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
The ratio of signal power to noise power on a channel, measured in decibels (dB). A higher SNR means a cleaner signal and allows higher data rates.

SNR is a key input to the Shannon capacity formula: `C = B * log2(1 + SNR)`, which gives the maximum achievable data rate for a channel with bandwidth B.
