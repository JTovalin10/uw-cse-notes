The act of receiving a packet on one link of a [[Switch]] and transmitting it on another. The switch reads an identifier in the packet header and uses a [[Forwarding Table]] to decide which output link to use.

Distinct from [[CSE461/Definitions/Routing]] — forwarding is the data-plane action, routing is the control-plane process that builds the tables forwarding relies on.
