## Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
A [[Multiplexing]] technique that divides time into fixed-length slots and assigns each slot to a different user or flow. Users take turns transmitting in their assigned time slot.

- Used in telephone networks and cellular systems ([[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]])
- Contrast with [[Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)|FDM]], which divides by frequency instead of time
