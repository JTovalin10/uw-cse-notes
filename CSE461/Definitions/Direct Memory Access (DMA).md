## Direct Memory Access (DMA)
A technique that allows hardware devices (such as [[Network Interface Card (NIC)|NICs]]) to transfer data directly to and from main memory without involving the CPU for each byte. This frees the CPU to do other work while the data transfer happens in the background.

Used in [[Software Switch|software switches]] where NICs copy incoming packets into main memory via DMA over the I/O bus.
