## Convergence
The process by which all routers in a network arrive at a consistent view of the network topology and agree on the best routes to all destinations. A routing protocol has converged when every router's routing table is stable and correct.

Convergence time matters because until the network converges, packets may be routed incorrectly or dropped. Distance-vector protocols generally converge more slowly than link-state protocols.
