## Software Defined Networking (SDN)
An architecture that decouples the **control plane** (routing decisions) from the **data plane** (packet forwarding), with the control plane moved into software running on commodity servers and the data plane implemented by bare-metal switches.

A standard interface between the two planes allows any control plane implementation to work with any data plane implementation.
