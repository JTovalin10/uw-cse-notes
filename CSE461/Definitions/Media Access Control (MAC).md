## Media Access Control (MAC)
Refers to two related concepts:
1. **MAC protocol** — the algorithm that controls how multiple devices share access to a common network medium (e.g., CSMA/CD for Ethernet)
2. **MAC address** — a unique 48-bit (6-byte) hardware address assigned to each [[Network Interface Card (NIC)|NIC]], used for link-layer addressing

MAC addresses are globally unique and used by switches to forward frames to the correct port.
