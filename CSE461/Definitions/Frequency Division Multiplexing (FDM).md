## Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
A [[Multiplexing]] technique that divides the available bandwidth of a link into separate frequency bands, each assigned to a different user or flow. All users transmit simultaneously on their own frequency band.

- Used in radio, TV, and cellular networks ([[Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM)|GSM]])
- Contrast with [[Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)|TDM]], which divides by time slots instead of frequency
