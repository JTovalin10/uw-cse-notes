## Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
A distance-vector routing protocol. Routers send their distance vectors (cost to reach each network) to neighbors every 30 seconds, and also send triggered updates when their routing table changes.

Uses hop count as the cost metric with a maximum of 15 hops (16 = infinity).
