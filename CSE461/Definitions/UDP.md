**User Datagram Protocol.** A transport-layer protocol that provides **unreliable datagram delivery** — no guarantees on ordering, delivery, or duplicate detection. Faster than [[TCP]] because it skips connection setup and reliability overhead.

One of the two main transport protocols in the Internet architecture, alongside [[TCP]].
