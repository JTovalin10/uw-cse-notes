How IP assigns and structures addresses to identify every host in an internetwork.

All [[IP Address|IP addresses]] are **32 bits** and **hierarchical** — split into a network part (identifies the physical network) and a host part (identifies the host on that network). This lets routers make forwarding decisions based on the network part alone.

- [[IP Address]] — structure, network/host parts, dotted decimal notation
- [[IP Global Addresses]] — classful addressing, Class A/B/C
- [[Subnet Mask]] — extracting subnet numbers via bitwise AND
- [[Subnetting]] — dividing one network number across multiple physical networks
- [[Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)]] — variable-length prefixes, aggregate routes
- [[Longest Prefix Match]] — resolving overlapping forwarding table entries
