How IP structures and delivers packets across heterogeneous networks.

IP uses a **best-effort** datagram service — it makes every effort to deliver packets but makes no guarantees. "Run over anything" is its most important characteristic.

## Topics

- [[IP Service Model]] — best-effort delivery, addressing scheme, datagram model
- [[IP Packet Format]] — header fields: version, HLen, TOS, TTL, flags, offset, protocol, checksum, addresses
- [[IP Fragmentation and Reassembly]] — splitting packets that exceed a network's [[Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)|MTU]]
- [[Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)]] — the largest datagram a network can carry in a frame
