The network layer provides a packet delivery service to hosts. There are two fundamental models for how this is done.

## Topics

- [[Store-and-Forward Packet Switching]] — the underlying mechanism both models are built on
- [[Datagrams]] — connectionless, each packet carries the full destination address
- [[Virtual Circuit Switching]] — connection-oriented, packets carry a small VCI instead of a full address
- [[Datagram vs Virtual Circuits]] — comparison of the two models
