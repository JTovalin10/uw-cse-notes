the main goal is to connect different link layer networks. This approach provides:
- scaling
	- hierarchy in the form of prefixes
- heterogeneity
	- ip for internetworking
- bandwidth control
	- lowest cost routing

## Short coming of switches
- link layer doesnt scale
- Don’t work across more than one link layer technology
- doesnt give much traffic control
