# Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- How many levels we can distinguish depends on S/N ratio
- SNR = Signal Power / Noise Power
- Given on a log-scale in decibels (dB):
$$SNR_{dB} = 10 \log_{10}(S/N)$$

| SNR (dB) | S/N Ratio | Quality |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 0 dB | 1:1 | Very noisy |
| 10 dB | 10:1 | Poor |
| 20 dB | 100:1 | Decent |
| 30 dB | 1000:1 | Good |
