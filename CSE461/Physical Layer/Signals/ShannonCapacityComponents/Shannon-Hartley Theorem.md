shannon limit is for capacity (C), the maximum **lossless** information carrying rate of the channel
# Shannon-Hartley Theorem
$$C = B \log_2(1 + S/N) \text{ bits/sec}$$

Where:
- C = channel capacity (bits/sec)
- B = bandwidth (Hz)
- S/N = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not dB)
	- if in dB then you can convert it to S/N with $10^{n/10}$
