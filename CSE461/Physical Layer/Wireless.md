- sender radiates signal over a region
	- in many directions, unlike a wire, to potentially many receivers
	- nearby signals (same freq.) interfere at a receiver; need to coordinate use
- unlicensed frequencies, e.g., WiFi, are widely used for computer networking
- various other effects
	- wireless propagation is complex, depends on environment
- some key effects highly frequency dependent
	- multi path at microwave frequencies
# multi path
- signals bounce off objects and take multiple paths
	- some frequencies attenuated at receiver, varies with location
