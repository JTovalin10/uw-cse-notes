# Definition
Rate (also called bandwidth, capacity, or speed) measured in bits/sec

# Common Units
[[RateComponents/Rate Units]]

# Important Distinction
- **Bandwidth** (physics): range of frequencies a channel can carry (Hz)
- **Bandwidth** (networking): data rate of a link (bits/sec)
- These are related: more frequency bandwidth → higher data rate

# Throughput vs Bandwidth
