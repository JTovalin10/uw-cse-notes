# Definition
Rate (also called bandwidth, capacity, or speed) measured in bits/sec

# Common Units
| Unit | Value | Example Use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| bps | 1 bit/sec | - |
| Kbps | $10^3$ bps | Dial-up modem |
| Mbps | $10^6$ bps | Home internet |
| Gbps | $10^9$ bps | Data centers |
| Tbps | $10^{12}$ bps | Backbone links |

# Important Distinction
- **Bandwidth** (physics): range of frequencies a channel can carry (Hz)
- **Bandwidth** (networking): data rate of a link (bits/sec)
- These are related: more frequency bandwidth → higher data rate

# Throughput vs Bandwidth
- **Bandwidth**: maximum theoretical rate
- **Throughput**: actual achieved rate (always ≤ bandwidth)
- Throughput affected by: congestion, protocol overhead, errors
