# Coding
[[Simple Rate Model]]
signal is sent directly on wire
- these signals do not propagate well as RF
	- need to send at higher frequencies
# [[Modulation]]
- carries a signal by modulating a carrier
	- baseband is signal pre-modulation
	- keying is the digital form of modulation (equiv to coding but using modulation)
