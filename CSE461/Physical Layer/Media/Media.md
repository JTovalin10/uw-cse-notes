#define media: a medium of cultivation, conveyance, or expression

# Types of Media
- Media propagates signals that carry bits of information
- Common types:
	- [[Wires]] (twisted pair, coaxial)
	- [[Fiber]] (fiber optic cables)
	- [[Physical Layer/Media/Wireless]] (radio, microwave, infrared)

# Comparison of Media Types
| Property | Wires | Fiber | Wireless |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Signal | Electrical | Light | Radio waves |
| Speed | Up to 10 Gbps | Up to 100+ Tbps | Up to several Gbps |
| Distance | ~100m | 100+ km | Varies (m to km) |
| Interference | Moderate | Very low | High |
| Security | Moderate | High (hard to tap) | Low (broadcast) |
| Cost | Low | High | Medium |
| Installation | Easy | Difficult | Easy |

# Which to Use?
- **Wires**: LANs, short distances, cost-sensitive
- **Fiber**: Long distances, high bandwidth, security-critical
- **Wireless**: Mobility needed, hard to cable, last-mile
