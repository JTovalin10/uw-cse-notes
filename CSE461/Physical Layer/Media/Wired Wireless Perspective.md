- wires, and fiber
	- engineer link to have requisite SNR and B
		- can fix data rate
		- measure once and you're good to go
- wireless
	- given B, but SNR varies greatly up to 60 dB
		- can't design for worst case, must **adapt data rate**
			- worse case may be 1mb/s whereas best case may be 500mb/s
		- Adapt data rate to SNR
