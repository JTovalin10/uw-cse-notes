- light propagates with very low loss in three very wide frequency bands
	- use a carrier to send information

# why
## massive capacity (bandwidth)
fiber has a huge range of available frequencies to carry data which means fiber can carry thousands of times more data per second than copper cables
## Extreme Distances
- Low loss means the light signal doesn't fade quickly as it travels over glass
	- copper: loses strength in just 100 meters
	- fiber: can travel 100+km without needing booster
## Wavelength Division Multiplexing
fiber can send multiple signals (wavelengths of light) down the same single strand of fiber at the same time which multiplies the speed of connection without laying new cables
