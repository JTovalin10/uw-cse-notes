1. TDM
	1. user sends at a high rate a fraction of time
	2. used for internet
		1. with high data rate we can do video calling as it is 100's of Mbps of bursts with ms in between think discrete
			1. however if there is a ton of people then it starts to get jittery as you split the time across many people
2. FDM
	1. a user sends at a low rate all the time
	2. better for analog systems
