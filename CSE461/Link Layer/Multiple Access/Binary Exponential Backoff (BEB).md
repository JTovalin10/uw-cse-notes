- estimate the probability, **randomly** choose $0 \text{ to n}$ as this prevents collisions from happening over and over again as its unlikely that n people will get the same number, this is uses $e^x$ which is rounded to the nearest integer.
	- 1st collision, wait 0 or 1 frame times
	- 2nd collision, wait from 0 to 3 times
	- 3rd collision, wait from 0 to 7 times...
- BEB doubles intervals for each successive collision
	- quickly gets large enough to work
	- very efficient in practice
