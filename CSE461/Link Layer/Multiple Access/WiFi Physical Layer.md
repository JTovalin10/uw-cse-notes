uses 20/40 MHz channels on ISM (unlicensed) bands
- 802.11b/g/n on 2.4 GHz
- 802.11 a/n on 5 GHz

OFDM Modulation (except legacy 802.11b)
- diff amplitudes/phases for varying SNRs
- rate from 6 to 54 Mbps plus error correction
- 802.11n uses multiple antennas

multi antennas increase data rate by:
- each antenna increases data rate by x
- it has to solve a linear equation however each antenna should be different
