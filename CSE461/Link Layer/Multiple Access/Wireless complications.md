1. media is infinite
	1. cant [[Carrier Sense]]
2. nodes cant hear while sending
	1. cant collision detect
# How it works
1. coverage
	1. wireless signals are broadcasts and receive nearby signals where there is sufficient [[Signal-to-Noise Ratio]]
2. hidden terminals
	1. node A and C are [[Hidden Terminals]] when sending to B

3. [[Exposed Terminals]]
	1. B and C are exposed terminals when sending to A and D
## Nodes
Nodes cant hear while sending as with wires, detecting collisions (and aborting) lowers their ccosts. This means it has more wasted time with wireless

Both communicating nodes need to send the same power in order to hear each other. Think: if you are yelling at someone you probably cant hear someone whispering to you instead if they are also yelling then you can probably hear them.
