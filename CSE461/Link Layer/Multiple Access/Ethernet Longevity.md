Ethernet has endured because of two key advantages:
1. **Simple administration** — no routing or configuration tables to maintain; adding a new host is trivial.
2. **Low cost** — cable/fiber is cheap, and the only per-host cost is the network adaptor.

These factors made Ethernet deeply entrenched. Switch-based Ethernet eventually replaced multi-access Ethernet, largely because it could be **deployed incrementally**: some hosts connected via point-to-point links to switches while others remained on shared coax with repeaters or hubs, all while retaining the same simple administration model.
