- **Transceiver**: a small device directly attached to the tap. It detects when the line is idle and drives the signal when the host is transmitting. It also receives incoming signals. The transceiver connects to an Ethernet adaptor plugged into the host.

- **Repeaters**: a device that forwards digital signals, like an amplifier. No more than four repeaters could be positioned between any pair of hosts.

- **Terminators**: placed at the ends of the cable, they absorb the signal and prevent it from bouncing back and interfering with trailing signals.
- **Collision domain**: all hosts competing for access to the same link. The multi-access part of Ethernet is all about dealing with the competition that arises in a collision domain.
