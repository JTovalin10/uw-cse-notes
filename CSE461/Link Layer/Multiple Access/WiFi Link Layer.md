Multiple access uses [[Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)]]; RTS/CA optional (only cares about avoiding collisions and [[Hidden Terminals]] problem)

frames are ACKed and retransmitted with [[Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)]], as it wants to mitigate any noise conflict

funky addresses

errors are detected with a 32-bit [[Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)|CRC]]
