- cant hear each other yet dont collide at shared receivers A and D
	- they dont collide, however when B or C sends to A or D (corresponding) the other will hear it and defer their own
	- this decreases throughput
- improves performance through concurrency
- With no carrier sense it is able to be concurrent
- with carrier sense it will see that B or C are busy so it wont send
