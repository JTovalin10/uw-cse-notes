Switches are used to build networks and are widely used in campus and enterprise networks.

They were commonly referred to as bridges, as they were used to build an extended LAN. Today, the terms "bridge" and "switch" are often used interchangeably in the context of Layer 2 forwarding.

See [[Learning Bridges]] for how these switches learn where to forward frames.
