Adds a [[Network Processor Unit (NPU)]] — a network-specific processor with an architecture and instruction set optimized for processing packet headers.
- Can be programmed to act as an L2 switch, L3 router, or combination of both
- Takes advantage of fast [[Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM)|SRAM]]-based memory to buffer packets while they are being processed
- Uses [[Ternary Content-Addressable Memory (TCAM)|TCAM]]-based memory that stores bit patterns to be matched against fields in the packet being processed
