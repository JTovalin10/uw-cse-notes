## IP Global Addresses
We need global addresses in order to provide an addressing scheme for the [[IP Service Model]]. This means each host must have a unique address.

IP addresses must be **hierarchical**: they are made up of several parts that correspond to some sort of hierarchy in the internetwork.
1. **Network part**
	1. identifies the network to which the host is attached
	2. all hosts attached to the same network have the same network part in their IP address
2. **Host part**
	1. identifies each host uniquely on that particular network

### Old Classes of IP
All addresses are 32 bits long. This system has a lot of flexibility, allowing networks of vastly different sizes to be accommodated efficiently.

Note: Claude, describe Class A, B, and C classes here as I didn't include how many hosts they can support and any other info.
