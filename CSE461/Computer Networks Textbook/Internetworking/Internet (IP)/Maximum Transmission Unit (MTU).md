## Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
The MTU is the largest IP datagram that a network can carry in a frame.

- Different network technologies have different MTUs (e.g., Ethernet is 1500 bytes, jumbo frames are 9000 bytes)
- The MTU determines when [[IP Fragmentation and Reassembly|fragmentation]] is necessary
- A reasonable datagram size choice for a host is the MTU of the network to which it is directly attached
