## Physical Properties

**Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO)** — the use of multiple antennas to improve performance.

## Collision Avoidance

WiFi uses the same basic algorithm as Ethernet, plus some additions:
- Wait until the link becomes idle before transmitting and back off should a collision occur.
- **Key difference from Ethernet**: a node on Ethernet receives every other node's transmissions and can transmit and receive at the same time — **neither of these conditions holds for wireless nodes**.
- This makes collision detection more complex in wireless.

## Hidden Node Problem

Wireless nodes cannot usually transmit and receive at the same time (on the same frequency) because the power generated by the transmitter is much higher than any received signal and swamps the receiving circuitry. A node may also not receive transmissions from another node because that node is too far away or blocked by an obstacle.

**Example:** A and C are both within range of B but not each other. Both A and C want to communicate with B, so they each send a frame. A and C are unaware of each other since their signals do not carry that far. The two frames collide at B, but unlike Ethernet, neither A nor C is aware of this collision. A and C are said to be **hidden nodes** with respect to each other.

## Exposed Node Problem

**Example:** Four nodes are arranged so each can only reach its immediate neighbors. B can exchange frames with A and C but cannot reach D; C can reach B and D but not A.

Suppose B is sending to A. Node C hears B's transmission and might incorrectly conclude it cannot transmit to anyone. However, C's transmission to D would **not** interfere with A's ability to receive from B. C is an **exposed node** — it is unnecessarily prevented from transmitting.

## Solving Hidden and Exposed Node Problems

Both problems can be addressed using [[CSMA-CD (Collision Detection)]] and [[Carrier Sense]] mechanisms.

## Distribution System

Some nodes are allowed to roam while others are connected to a wired network infrastructure.

Although two nodes can communicate directly if they are within reach of each other, the idea behind this configuration is that each node **associates** itself with one access point (AP).

The technique for selecting an AP is called **scanning** and involves four steps:

1. The node sends a `Probe` frame.
2. All APs within reach reply with a `Probe Response` frame.
3. The node selects one of the access points and sends that AP an `Association Request` frame.
4. The AP replies with an `Association Response` frame.
