Spread spectrum is a technique that spreads the signal over a wider frequency band to minimize the impact of interference from other devices. There are two main approaches:

## Frequency Hopping

- The signal is transmitted over a **random sequence of frequencies** — transmit at one frequency, then hop to another, then another, etc.
- The sequence is not truly random but generated by a **pseudorandom number generator**.
- The receiver uses the **same algorithm and seed** as the sender, so both hop to the same frequency in sync and can correctly receive frames.
- It is unlikely that two signals use the same frequency for more than the occasional isolated bit.

## Direct Sequence

- Adds **redundancy** for greater tolerance of interference.
- Each bit of data is represented by **multiple bits** in the transmitted signal, so if some transmitted bits are damaged by interference, there is usually enough redundancy to recover the original bit.
- For each bit the sender wants to transmit, it actually sends the **exclusive-OR** of that bit and *n* random bits. As with frequency hopping, the sequence of random bits is generated by a pseudorandom number generator known to both the sender and the receiver.
- The transmitted values are known as an *n*-bit **chipping code**. The chipping code spreads the signal across a frequency band that is *n* times wider than the frame would have otherwise required.
