At its core, the link layer is how we transmit raw bits over a medium (wireless or wired). They both carry analog signals (continuous wavelength) while we want to transmit digital signals (0, 1 or discrete wavelength).

## Coding and Modulation
### Simple Coding
[[Non-Return to Zero (NRZ)]]
[[Return to Zero (RZ)]]]
### Additions
what we can do is create 4 levels for 4 bits per symbol. for example
lets say:
0 Hz = 00
100 Hz = 01
200 Hz = 10
300 Hz = 11
This allows us to have more bits per second
