- For each column, use $2^{n-1}$ to figure out the T or F placement
- Example: a = $2^{2-1}$ therefore T should be every 2 rows and b = $2^{1-1}$ therefore T should alternate every 1 rows

| a   | b   |
| --- | --- |
| T   | T   |
| T   | F   |
| F   | T   |
| F   | F   |
# Contrapositive:
The contrapositive has the same truth value as its original statement
