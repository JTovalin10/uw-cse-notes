if $x$ is a variable of type $T$ then the statement is read as $x:T$
- Data types are sets. the most basic of which are 
$$
\mathbb{N} = \text{natural numbers}
$$
$$
\mathbb{Z} = \text{all integers}
$$
$$
\mathbb{R} = \text{all real numbers}
$$
$$
\mathbb{B} = \text{the boolean values}
$$
$$
\mathbb{H} = \text{any character}
$$
$$
\mathbb{H^*} = \text{any sequence of characters (strings)}
$$
