A **formal** system is built on a precise set of rules for its syntax (how expressions are written) and semantics (what they mean). The goal is to eliminate all ambiguity so that a statement or expression can only be interpreted in one way. This is crucial for computers and mathematical proofs. 🤖

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Unambiguous**: Each statement has exactly one meaning.
    
- **Rule-Based**: Follows a strict grammar and logic.
    
- **Symbolic**: Often uses specialized symbols and notation.
    

**Examples from our conversation:**

- The type definition `type Beat := {count : N, up : B}` is **formal**.
    
- The function pattern `dance({count: 0, up: T}) := 1` is **formal**. It's a piece of code that a machine or another computer scientist can parse and understand precisely.

## Informal Descriptions

An **informal** description uses natural language to explain what a formal system _does_ or _means_. It prioritizes clarity and understanding for a human reader over machine-level precision. It often uses analogies and simplifies complex ideas. 🗣️

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Intuitive**: Aims to build understanding and give a "feel" for the concept.
    
- **Uses Natural Language**: Written in English, Spanish, etc.
    
- **Can be Ambiguous**: May rely on context and shared understanding to make sense.
    

**Examples from our conversation:**

- My explanation, "**Exclusive** means the patterns don't overlap," is **informal**.
    
- Describing a pattern's purpose, such as "this line handles the case where the count is zero and up is true," is an **informal** explanation of the formal code.
