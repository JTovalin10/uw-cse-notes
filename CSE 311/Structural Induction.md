To prove $\forall x \in S, P(X)$
**Base Case**: Show that 𝑃(𝑢) is true for all specific elements 𝑢 of 𝑆 mentioned in the Basis step

**Induction Hypothesis**: Assume that 𝑃 is true for some arbitrary values of each of the existing named elements mentioned in the Recursive step

**Induction Step**: Prove that 𝑃(𝑤) holds for each of the **new elements** 𝑤 constructed in the Recursive step using the named elements mentioned in the Inductive

**Conclude**: that $\forall x \in S, P(X)$
