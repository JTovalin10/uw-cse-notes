# Why is usability important
- People the critical element of any computer system
- Even if it is possible for a system to protect against adversary, people may use the system in other, less secure ways
# HTTP Indicators + SSL warnings
- the lock icon shows a user that the page is secure against a network attacker (main in the middle)
- This doesnt mean that the website is safe
# Phising
- active warnings are present in case the website is a phony website that warns the user the website isnt the one they are thiniing it is
	- making the "i acknowledge button" difficult to find is better as having it present at the frotn just makes people click it as they wont read the pop up
	- opinionated design
		- has accepted risk and visit and manage tracker
	- manipulated design
		- has an thing where you have to accept all responsiability before entering
## Reasons warnings fail
- dont trust the warning
- ignore it as its familiar
- however it does reduce the number of people entering a insecure site
## ways attackers confuse users
- make a site that doesnt have https
- the website is bankofthevvest instead of bankofthewest (look at the w)
- picture in picture attacks
	- more trained users fall for this
# Password Managers
- despite people knowing they should have differnet passwords for different accounts most people reuse the same password
	- so all it takes is one hacked password from one website and this person is toast
- using a password manager is better as it generates passwords for you
- using pwd hash
	- if you reuse a password and use a hash then if someone gets ahold of one password youre cooked
	- a clever way is to use <domain><password> in the hash as the hash will be different for each domain and you can reuse the password part
