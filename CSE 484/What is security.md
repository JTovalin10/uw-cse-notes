Security mindset includes:
- hardest part of building a secure system is figuring our what security means
- who are the **stakeholders** for which we are considering "security"
- what are the **assets** to protect
- what are the **threats** to those assests
- what is the **security policy or goals**
- who are the **adversaries**, and what are their **resources**
