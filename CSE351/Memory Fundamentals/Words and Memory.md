# Words and Memory

## Word Size
**Word size** is the number of bits used by the CPU in execution of instructions.
- 64-bit systems: 8 bytes = 64 bits

**Related:** [[x86-64 Registers]], [[CSE451/Virtual Memory/Virtual Memory]]

## Memory (RAM)
**Memory** (Random-Access Memory) is a separate hardware component that acts as local data storage for the CPU during instruction execution.

**Related:** [[CSE484/Memory Exploits/Memory Layout]], [[The Stack]]

## Addresses
Each byte in memory is given a **unique memory address**. The address space is fixed by your RAM capacity.

- Addresses are typically represented in hexadecimal
- On 64-bit systems, addresses are 8 bytes wide
