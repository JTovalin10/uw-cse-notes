# Operations
- the file system interface defines standard operations
	- file (or dir) creation or deletion
	- manipulation of files and directories (read, write, extend, rename, protect)
	- copy
	- lock
- file systems also provide higher level services
	- accounting and quotas
	- backup (must be incremental and online)
	- (sometimes) indexing or search
	- (sometimes) file versioning
