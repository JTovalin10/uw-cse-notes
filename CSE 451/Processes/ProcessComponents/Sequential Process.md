- procs are data structures
	- dynamically allocated inside OS memory
- the process is the OS's abstraction for execution
	- A process is a program in execution
- Simplest case: **Sequential Process**
	- an address space
	- a single thread of execution
- A sequential process is
	- the unit of execution
	- the unit of scheduling
	- the dynamic (active) execution context
		-  vs. the program - static, just a bunch of bytes
