The name for a process is called a [[Process ID]]

# What is it
[[Sequential Process]]

[[Process Lifecycle Events]]

[[Process Creation]]

# OSTEP
OSTEP defines it as *A running program* where we have to understand its [[Machine State]]

A process is an **abstraction** provided by the OS that encapsulates:
- The program code (text segment)
- Current activity (program counter, registers)
- Memory (stack, heap, data segments)
- OS resources (open files, network connections)
