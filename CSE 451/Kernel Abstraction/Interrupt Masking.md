- [[Interrupt Handler]] runs with interrupt off
	- is re enabled when interrupt completes
- OS kernel can also turn [[Interrupts]] off
	- Eg. when determining the next process/thread to run
	- on x86
		- only in kernel mode
		- [[CLI]]: disable interrupts
		- [[STI]]: enables interrupts
		- only applies to current CPU (on a multicore)
- If another device interrupts during interrupt off
	- it raises an interrupt and when interrupts turn back on, the interrupt handler sees it and takes action
