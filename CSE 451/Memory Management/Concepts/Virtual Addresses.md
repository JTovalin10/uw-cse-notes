Processes use virtual addresses that are independent of the location in physical memory
- OS determines location in physical memory
Instructions issued by CPU reference virtual addresses

Virtual addresses are translated by hardware into physical addresses (with setup by OS)

The set of virtual addresses a process can reference is called its address space
