This algorithm has the lowest fault rate (proveable) and all it does is:
1. evict the page that wont be used for the longtest time in the future
2. problem: impossible to predit the future

This algorithm is mainly is only useful as a measuring tool to compare other algorithms to check if this one isnt that much better than yours
