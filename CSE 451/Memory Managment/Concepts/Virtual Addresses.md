processes use virtual addresses that is independent of the location in physical addresses
- OS determines location in physical memory
instructions issued by CPU reference virtual addresses

virtual addresses are translated by hardware into physical addresses (with set up by OS)

a set of virtual addresses a process can reference is called address space
