# Operations
- wait
	- wait until some thread does a signal and release the associated lock, as an [[Atomic]] operation
- signal
	- if any threads are waiting, wake up one
	- cannot proceed until lock re-acquired
- signal() is not remembered
	- a signal to a condition variable that has no threads waiting is a no-op
- Qualitative use guideline
	- you wait() when you cant proceed until some shared state changes
	- you signal() when shared state changes from "bad" to "good"
