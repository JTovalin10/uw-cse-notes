- Bits are transmitted over a radio or modulated onto a wire
	- think of sin(x) graph
	- physical layer specifies how bits are encoded at a signal level
	- can be encodes as 
		- 1
			- +1v
			- -1v
		- 0 
			- +0v
			- -0v
- NIC - network interface controller
	- translate information between computers
	- Has a 48bit hardware address
		- Visible on hardware level
	- Transmits data and looks for receiving data
