# CSE 333 - Systems Programming

## Course Overview

CSE 333 focuses on low-level systems programming in C and C++. The course covers memory management, file I/O, networking, and the tools needed to build robust systems software.

## Topics Covered

### Memory Management
- Pointers and pointer arithmetic
- Stack vs heap memory
- Dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free)
- Memory layout and data type sizes
- Common pitfalls: double free, dangling pointers

### Data Structures in C
- Structs and struct allocation
- Linked lists
- Vectors (C++ STL)

### C Preprocessor
- Header files and include guards
- Macros and conditional compilation
- Client headers

### Build Systems
- Makefiles for C and C++
- Dependency diagrams
- Compilation and linking process

### File I/O and POSIX
- POSIX file operations: open, close, read, write
- File descriptors and modes
- Error handling with perror
- Creating files with creat

### C++ Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance (single and multiple)
- Virtual functions and dynamic dispatch
- Virtual tables (vtables)
- Pure virtual specifiers and abstract classes
- Override keyword
- Copy constructors
- Upcasting
- C++ casting operators

### Smart Pointers
- Unique pointers
- Shared pointers
- Weak pointers
- Move semantics
- new and delete operators

### Networking
- OSI model layers (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Application)
- Sockets: stream sockets (TCP), datagram sockets (UDP), raw sockets
- Client-side networking
- Server-side programming
- Socket API and TCP connections
- DNS resolution and IP addresses
- HTTP protocol basics

### Process Management
- Creating new processes (fork/exec)
