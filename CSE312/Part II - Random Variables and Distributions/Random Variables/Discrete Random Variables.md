- The probability of this being 0 is the same as impossible
- Relative Chances
	- PMF: $p_X(k) = P(X = k)$
- Events
	- Sum over PMF to get probability
- Convert from CDF to PMF
	- look for "breakpoints" in CDF to PMF
- Convert PMF to CDF
	- Sum up PMF to get CDF
$$
E[X] = \sum_{w}X(w) \cdot p_X(w)

$$
E[g(x)] = \sum_{w}g(X(w)) \cdot p_X(w)

$$
Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
