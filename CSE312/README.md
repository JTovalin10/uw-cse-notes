# CSE 312 - Foundations of Computing II

## Course Overview

CSE 312 covers the foundations of probability and statistics with applications to computer science. This course builds mathematical reasoning skills essential for algorithm analysis, machine learning, and data science.

## Topics Covered

### Counting and Combinatorics
- Product rule, sum rule, and factorial
- Permutations and combinations
- Binomial theorem and Pascal's identity
- Pigeonhole principle
- Stars and bars (multiset counting)
- Principle of inclusion-exclusion
- Complementary counting and overcounting

### Basic Probability
- Conditional probability and independence
- Bayes' rule and chain rule
- Law of total probability
- Mutual exclusion
- Union bound

### Random Variables
- Discrete and continuous random variables
- Probability mass functions (PMF)
- Cumulative distribution functions (CDF)
- Support and range

### Distributions
- Common distributions
- Normal (Gaussian) random variables

### Expectation and Variance
- Expected value and linearity of expectation
- Variance and standard deviation
- Covariance
- Joint and conditional expectation
- Law of total expectation

### Inequalities and Bounds
- Markov's inequality
- Chebyshev's inequality
- Hoeffding's inequality
- Chernoff bound (multiplicative form)

### Statistical Inference
- Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
- Central limit theorem
- Confidence intervals

## Key Formulas

- **Bayes' Rule:** P(B|A) = P(A|B)P(B) / P(A)
- **Expectation:** E[X] = sum of k * P(X=k) for all k in support
- **Variance:** Var(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
